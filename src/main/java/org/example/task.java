    1. Setting Breakpoints:

     - Open a simple Java project in IntelliJ.
     - Set breakpoints at various points in your code, such as the beginning of methods or loops.
     - Debug the program and observe how the execution pauses at each breakpoint.




    2. Inspecting Variables:

      - Create a Java class with variables of different types (int, String, Object, etc.).
      - Set breakpoints at different locations where these variables are accessible.
      - Debug the program and use IntelliJ's debugger to inspect the values of these variables at each breakpoint.




    3. Stepping Through Code:

      - Write a method with nested loops or conditional statements.
        - Set breakpoints within the loops or conditionals.
        - Debug the program and use IntelliJ's step over, step into, and step out features to navigate through the code execution.



    4. Conditional Breakpoints:

        - Modify your code to include a loop that iterates over an array or collection.
        - Set a breakpoint within the loop, but this time make it conditional (e.g., break when a certain variable reaches a specific value).
        - Debug the program and observe how the debugger behaves when the condition is met.




    5. Watch and Evaluate Expressions:

        - Write a method that performs a series of mathematical operations.
        - Set breakpoints at various points within the method.
        - Use IntelliJ's watch feature to monitor the value of an expression as you step through the code.
        - Also, try using the evaluate expression feature to calculate and inspect values at runtime


    6. Exception Handling:

        - Write a method that might throw an exception under certain conditions (e.g., divide by zero).
        - Set breakpoints at the beginning of the method and within the catch block.
        - Debug the program and observe how IntelliJ's debugger helps you navigate through the exception handling process.




    7. Remote Debugging:

        - Set up a remote debugging configuration in IntelliJ.
        - Deploy a simple Java application (e.g., a servlet) to a server.
        - Attach IntelliJ's debugger to the remote server and debug the application remotely.
        - Practice setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping through code remotely.
